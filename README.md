# Getting Started
Navigate to a folder in your local environment and copy/paste the following commands into your terminal:
```
  git clone git@github.com:nathanzebedee/solana-development.git
  cd solana-development
  nvm install 16
  nvm use 16
  yarn
  yarn dev
```
At this point, the repository should be installed to your computer and hosted on your browser at http://localhost:3000.

# Workflow
For each project, there is a card which contians a brief description of the project, as well as two buttons: "preview" and "starter". 
* The "preview" button, when clicked, will direct you to a finished version of the project. This is for your reference as you build the project on your own. 
* The "starter" button, when clicked, will take you to a blank page. The pages labeled "starter.jsx" within your repository are blank files that you will use to build out your own version of the given project.
