# A Solana Frontend Development Course by Helius
Hey there! This repository was 
Hey Baylor Bears! This repository was designed by [Nathan Galindo](https://twitter.com/_zebedee_) on behalf of [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/). It is a course that is made up of a series of projects to help you get started developing frontend applications on [Solana](https://solana.com/). Why Solana? Because Solana is a third-generation protocol with incredibly high throughput and astonishingly low transaction fees, making it an ideal blockchain for builders to hack out the next generation of the internet!

# Tech Stack
This course focuses on front-end development, and challenges you to build small applications using industry standard front-end technologies as well as some web3 frameworks to interact with the [Solana JSON RPC API](https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCZyftNFV4i4Sygxkr6LdPazw2sLMPyhQbVqFID-yy8QSqf81dxJHUoaAk2ZEALw_wcB). Listed below are the main frameworks and tools you will be working with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)
- [solana/spl-token](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/token/js/index.html)
- [solana/wallet-adapter-react](https://solana-labs.github.io/wallet-adapter/)

The frameworks and tools used to build out these projects were carefully selected because they are the tools real companies are using in the blockchain industry to build out production applications. Even though they may be new to you, becoming familiar with them will greatly benefit your hireability as a software engineer (both within, and beyond the blockchain industry)!

# Getting Started
Navigate to a folder in your local environment and copy/paste the following commands into your terminal:
```
  git clone git@github.com:masterzorgon/solana-frontend-development-course.git
  cd solana-frontend-development-course
  nvm install 16
  nvm use 16
  yarn
  yarn dev
```
At this point, the repository should be installed to your computer and hosted on your browser at http://localhost:3000.

# Workflow
For each project, there is a card which contains a brief description of the project, as well as two buttons: "preview" and "starter". 
* The "preview" button, when clicked, will direct you to a finished version of the project. This is for your reference as you build the project on your own. 
* The "starter" button, when clicked, will take you to a blank page. The pages labeled "starter.jsx" within your repository are blank files that you will use to build out your own version of the given project.
